# Plant Disease Detection

## Overview

The Plant Disease Detection project aims to identify plant diseases using machine learning techniques. By leveraging image processing and classification models, the system can help farmers and agricultural experts in early detection and management of plant diseases, ultimately improving crop yield and quality.

## Features

- **Image Upload**: Users can upload images of plant leaves.
- **Disease Classification**: The system classifies the uploaded image to detect the type of disease.
- **Disease Information**: Detailed information about the detected disease is provided, including symptoms and possible treatments.
- **History and Reporting**: Users can view their past submissions and generate reports for analysis.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React.js for a responsive and interactive user interface.
- **Machine Learning**: TensorFlow/Keras for training and deploying the disease detection model.
- **Image Processing**: OpenCV for preprocessing and feature extraction from images.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed
- Python with TensorFlow and OpenCV installed

## Usage

1. Navigate to the application URL.
2. Upload an image of a plant leaf.
3. View the detected disease and corresponding information.
4. Optionally, save the report for future reference.

## Dataset

The model was trained on the Plant Village dataset, which contains images of healthy and diseased plant leaves.
